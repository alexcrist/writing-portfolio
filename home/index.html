            My name is Alex Crist. Having graduated from Northeastern University
            in May of 2019 with a BS in Computer Science, my future plans are
            malleable.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I enjoy rock climbing, data science, and working with
            others. I'm particularly interested by the ever expanding overlap
            between technology and human society which I believe will pose
            serious ethical conundrums.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In this portfolio of my writing, you will find an academic research
            paper on the computability-potential of several ethical frameworks
            as well as two blog posts.
