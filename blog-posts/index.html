            Calculated Judgement through Machine Eyes
        </a>
        <div class="writing">
            Building off of the work from my computational ethics research
            paper, this blog post details a fictious scenario in the future in
            which an autonomous vehicle crashes. Through this story, the kinds
            of data that may weigh into a moral calculation is discussed using
            the results of MIT's Moral Machine experiment. From here, a Leben's
            Ralwsian algorithm for autonomous vehicles is described as an
            example of how computers could make ethical decisions in the future.
